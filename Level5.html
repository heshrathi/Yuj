    <h4>About Chaturanga Dandasana</h4>
    <br>
    <p>In Sanskrit ‘Chatur’ means ‘four limbs’, ‘Danda’ means ‘staff of support’ and ‘Asana’, means ‘posture’. In Four Limbed Staff Pose (Chaturanga Dandasana), staff is referred to as the spinal cord, which is the main support system of the body. This pose is one of the steps in the group of 12 yoga poses in Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutation) and is considered as a powerful strength builder in the arms and abs. <br>

        Chaturanga Dandasana is considered a base pose as chaturanga dandasana variations can be derived from this pose.Chaturanga Dandasana helps boost energy in the body and hence can be included in flow yoga sequences. <br> <br> </p>
        
        <h4>Benifits</h4> 
        <p><strong>Strong arm muscles:</strong>  This pose, most certainly requires strength at the upper arms and the forearms to get comfortable with the posture. Repeated practice of balancing the body on the arms, will encourage the muscles around the upper arms to expand and contract with breathing and bring in strength gradually. <br> <br>
        <strong>Strong muscles around the shoulders:</strong>  When we talk about strengthening the arms, indirectly the shoulders to play a role in getting its exercise and hence during this pose the shoulder muscles are activated and gradually they become strong. <br> <br>
        <strong>Core Strength:</strong>  While one generally makes the mistake of putting their entire body weight on their wrists, this is totally wrong. The practice of Chaturanga Dandasana is from the core, where the abdominal muscles use their strength to hold the body almost parallel to the floor. The weight of the body hence should be at the core, slowly strengthening the core or abs and building endurance slowly. <br> <br>
        <strong>Posture of Spine is improved:</strong>  While for the beginners it is difficult to bring the body almost parallel to the floor bending the elbows, but a slow progress in this practice will change the posture of the spine and bring the shape of the spine to its natural one. Thus making this pose suitable for improving the posture of the upper back and spine. <br> <br>
        <strong>Flexibility of the lower arms:</strong>  Bending of the elbows in this pose is the most important part of the posture. Apart from the development of the strength of the arm muscles, it also works on improving the flexibility of the elbows and the wrists while strengthening it too. <br> <br>
        <strong>Lengthens the Spine:</strong>  Most of the muscles in this pose at the psoas will lengthen as the upper body pulls away from the toes. This will help in lengthening the spine too as the muscles around the spine will expand and lengthen. The muscles around at the back of the neck will remain long too as you lower. <br> <br>
        <strong>Complete Awareness of the body and breath:</strong>  With Chaturanga Dandasana, the entire body feels the same stretch and muscle efforts all over. This is essential for building endurance in the posture which leads to complete awareness of the body. The alignment of the body can be maintained only with awareness of the body and the mind along with proper breathing. <br> <br>
        <strong>Great for Hip Opening:</strong>  As the weight of the body is mostly at the core, the centre, a lot of the pressure would be at the hip to maintain this body weight. The muscles around the hip and close to the upper hamstrings work hard to maintain the body parallel to the floor or mat. This acts therefore as a great hip opener for the practice at the Intermediate Level. <br> <br>
        <strong>Strengthens the Upper Back and Chest:</strong>  Four Limbed Staff Pose keeps the body in great alignment using the strength of the chest and the upper back along with the hip. In doing so the muscles around the chest and the upper back get strong and toned. <br> <br>
        <strong>Works great with the digestive system:</strong>  As this pose works from the core, strengthening the abdominal muscles, the abdominal organs begin to function completely and hence the digestive system will be at its best. This pose most certainly needs repetitive practice. <br><br> </p>
        
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        
        <p> <strong>Step 1:</strong> From Plank Pose, align your shoulders slightly ahead of the wrists and come onto the balls of your feet, pressing the soles of your feet back, as if into a wall behind you. <br>
        
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Simultaneously push back through the heels to engage the quadriceps and bring the lower body to life, and reach your sternum forward, creating a straight, taut line of energy from the crown of your head through your feet. <br>
        
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> On an inhalation, draw the heads of the shoulders and the tops of the thighs up and away from the floor, pull your lower body up and in, and release the tailbone toward the floor. <br>
        
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> On an exhalation, bend your elbows, keeping them over your wrists and drawn in against your sides. Slowly lower yourself toward the floor, keeping your body as straight as a plank of wood, neither letting your center sag nor sticking your buttocks up in the air. <br>
        
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Bring your gaze to the floor, about 6 inches in front of you, and continue to lower until your shoulders are at the same height as your elbows. <br>
        
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Continue to reach through the heels, sternum, and crown of the head as you breathe. <br>
        
        <strong>Step 7:</strong> To come out of the pose, exhale and lower down to your belly or push back up to Plank Pose. Or inhale and come onto the tops of your feet and into Upward-Facing Dog.</p>
