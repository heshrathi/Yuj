    <h4>About Urdhva Mukha Svanasana</h4>
    <p>The name Urdhva Mukha Svanasana, comes from the Sanskrit words, ‘urdhva’ = ‘ ‘upward’ ,‘mukha’ = ‘face’ and
        ‘svan’ = ‘dog’. Hence it is also called the Upward Facing Dog Pose. The body stretches like the way a dog
        generally stretches and hence the name. This backbend pose works to a great extend on the arms and shoulders
        strength. This pose is similar to Bhujangasana or the Cobra Pose, the only difference being, that in Cobra Pose
        the entire lower body touches the floor making a deep back bend and in Upward Facing Dog Pose the lower body
        from the hips to the ankles are just above the floor and does not touch the floor. Hence the strength of the
        arms and the shoulders are put to test. <br>

        Urdhva Mukha Svanasana is considered a base pose as urdhva mukha svanasana variations can be derived from this
        pose.Urdhva Mukha Svanasana helps boost energy in the body and hence can be included in flow yoga
        sequences.Urdhva Mukha Svanasana is considered a warm-up yoga pose to prepare the body for more intense yoga
        poses / yoga flows. <br> <br></p>
    <h4>Benifits</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Opening of the chest helps deep proper breathing improving the lung capacity:</strong> The deep upper
        chest expansion, while taking it backwards creates a great stretch opening the chest muscles inducing a better
        flow of prana or oxygen. This improves the lung capacity to a great extent. <br>
        <strong>Acts as a great pose to heal back pain:</strong> The deep stretch of the upper back keeping the lower
        back pressed close to the floor, helps in tightening the lower back muscles, thus reducing the stiffness and
        pain around there. <br>
        <strong>Acts as a great pose to tighten the shoulders and the arms:</strong> The shoulders get the maximum
        stretch along with the arms as the weight of the body to some extent will be borne by the arms and the
        shoulders, which improves the strength of the shoulders and the arms giving it a good tight and well toned look.
        <br>
        <strong>Improves the posture with the stretching of the spine and the shoulders:</strong> While practicing
        Upward Facing Dog Pose, keep the alignment in mind which will help in improving the posture of the upper back
        and shoulders. This pose when done well will add beauty to the entire body with the improved posture. <br>
        <strong>Activates the glands giving freshness to the entire body:</strong> With the deep stretch of the neck,
        chest and the head, Urdhva Mukha Svanasana, activates all the glands and awakens the entire body giving a sense
        of freshness and alertness.
        Works for asthma patients: A deep stretch of the chest and the diaphragm improves the lung capacity with deeper
        breathing, thus fighting asthma. <br>
        <strong>Tones the lower part of the body:</strong> With the lower part of the body not touching the floor in
        Upward Facing Dog Pose, the hips, buttocks, hamstrings, calves and the entire leg have the muscles tightened and
        further tones the body. <br>
        <strong>Improved blood circulation to the entire body:</strong> Most poses related to the expansion of the spine
        improves the blood circulation of the entire body and here in this pose too, Urdhva Mukha Svanasana, the prana
        flows easily into the spine and throughout the entire body. The proper flow of blood in the entire body also
        awakens the body and keep you fresh during the large part of the day. <br> <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 1</strong> <br>

        Lie prone on the floor. Stretch your legs back, with the tops of your feet on the floor. Bend your elbows and
        spread your palms on the floor beside your waist so that your forearms are relatively perpendicular to the
        floor. <br>

        
        <strong>Step 2</strong> <br>

        Inhale and press your inner hands firmly into the floor and slightly back, as if you were trying to push
        yourself forward along the floor. Then straighten your arms and simultaneously lift your torso up and your legs
        a few inches off the floor on an inhalation. Keep the thighs firm and slightly turned inward, the arms firm and
        turned out so the elbow creases face forward. <br>

        
        <strong>Step 3</strong> <br>

        Press the tailbone toward the pubis and lift the pubis toward the navel. Narrow the hip points. Firm but don’t
        harden the buttocks. <br>

        
        <strong>Step 4</strong> <br>

        Firm the shoulder blades against the back and puff the side ribs forward. Lift through the top of the sternum
        but avoid pushing the front ribs forward, which only hardens the lower back. Look straight ahead or tip the head
        back slightly, but take care not to compress the back of the neck and harden the throat. <br>

        <strong>Step 5</strong> <br>

        Urdhva Mukha Svanasana is one of the positions in the traditional Sun Salutation sequence. You can also practice
        this pose individually, holding it anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds, breathing easily. Release back to the floor
        or lift into Adho Mukha Svanasana with an exhalation.
