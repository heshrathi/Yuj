    <h4>About Tadasana</h4>
    <p>Mountain Pose, also called Tadasana, Samasthiti, or Equal Standing Pose, is one of the most basic yoga poses
        postures. It’s one of the postures in Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutations), vinyasas, and a starting point for
        standing postures.
        Standing upright is something we do every day, and it may seem like there’s not much going on, and that Mountain
        Pose is not difficult. However, if Mountain Pose is performed correctly, there’s quite a lot going on.
    </p>
    <h4>Tadasana Benefits</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Comfortable Stretching of Muscles: </strong><br>
        The entire body is stretched and therefore the muscles too are stretched giving room for expansion of the muscles in the most simplest way.
Stronger Ankles and Knees: The legs become strong at the ankles and the knees. With long periods of practice in this pose, the toning of the leg muscles will help to practice all other standing asanas with ease. <br>
<strong>Efficient Prana Flow: </strong><br>
The hips are raised and this brings a good support to the entire back ensuring the spine is expanded giving room for proper flow of prana to the entire body. <br>
<strong>Correct Posture: </strong><br>
Toning of the chest and the shoulders helps in removing any bad postures and results in strong upper back. <br>
<strong>Tones Abdominal Muscles and Lengthens Spine: </strong><br>
Focus should be to keep the spine straight by pulling in the tummy. This eventually helps in toning of the abdominal muscles and lengthens the spine. <br>
<strong>Lighter Body: </strong><br>
This pose will help to keep the body light which is essential for the practice of most other poses.

    <h4>Tadasana Step-by-Step Instructions</h4>
    <p>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong><br>
        Stand with the bases of your big toes touching, heels slightly apart (so that your second toes are parallel). Lift and spread your toes and the balls of your feet, then lay them softly down on the floor. Rock back and forth and side to side. Gradually reduce this swaying to a standstill, with your weight balanced evenly on the feet.
        <br>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong><br>
        
        Firm your thigh muscles and lift the knee caps, without hardening your lower belly. Lift the inner ankles to strengthen the inner arches, then imagine a line of energy all the way up along your inner thighs to your groins, and from there through the core of your torso, neck, and head, and out through the crown of your head. Turn the upper thighs slightly inward. Lengthen your tailbone toward the floor and lift the pubis toward the navel.
        <br>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong><br>
        
        Press your shoulder blades into your back, then widen them across and release them down your back. Without pushing your lower front ribs forward, lift the top of your sternum straight toward the ceiling. Widen your collarbones. Hang your arms beside the torso.
        <br>
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong><br>
        
        Balance the crown of your head directly over the center of your pelvis, with the underside of your chin parallel to the floor, throat soft, and the tongue wide and flat on the floor of your mouth. Soften your eyes.
        <br>
        <p><strong>Step 5</strong><br>
        
        Tadasana is usually the starting position for all the standing poses. But it’s useful to practice Tadasana as a pose in itself. Stay in the pose for 30 seconds to 1 minute, breathing easily.</p>
